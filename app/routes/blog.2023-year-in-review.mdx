As we all are sitting here looking to the future and hoping for the best for what 2024 has in store. Lets take a minute (or like 5 or 6, some of us are not fast readers) to look back at 2023 and see where were were, where we went, and where we are going.

Rolling into 2023, I had been on the same project at work for what would end up being almost four years. Being on a project that long gives you a sense of comfort. You have been working on the same thing for years and are, hopefully, an expert in the technologies you are using and the subject domain. Not only that but you probably have some level of attachment to the parts of the project you enjoyed and created. This was easily my most successful project I have ever been on. Not only did I get a chance to explore and grow my skills in every aspect of my job, but the project team as a whole took on an extreme challenge of retiring a 20 year old system and replacing with a modern solution that can more easily grow and be maintained.

What a wild ride! It is going to be a long time before I have another project that can compete with this one in terms of accomplishments and growth.

Ok, ok. So I had this amazing project and all this growth on a project that I was very familiar and comfortable with. Naturally the next step is to hand off all this work to a new contractor and roll off this project. The good news here is that a good amount of what was worked on had some decent getting started guides as the team had changed over the course of the 4 years. So after spending a few months on improving documentation and diagrams and talking and working hands on with developers new to the project, I was finally rolled off the project. It was extremely nerve racking to let go of this project and hand off to developers that were new to the project and had just spent the past few months drinking from the firehose that is me talking about something I worked on for years. No amount of time would have made this easier but we had to get it done and we did. I'm off the project and finally should have a break between projects...

Just kidding, I was rolled directly into a project discovery that would roll directly into implementation. This was a stark contrast to my previous project. I went from a project with 100+ team members, leading teams, leading cross project initiatives, and leading design and implementation of our design system shared component library to working on a team of less than 10 where I wasn't even able to merge my own PRs.

Ok, so we have been on this new project for the duration of the year. In that time I had to effectively, re-prove myself as an effective developer and as a leader. Naturally, it wasn't very hard to prove my technical skills, but what is always much harder is to find ways to leverage my leadership skill on a project while surrounded with developers much more senior than myself.

Fighting against my natural inclinations and self doubt, I decided my best course of action is to ignore all of that and force myself to look past years of experience and speak up with my thoughts and opinions where I knew I could provide value. At times it was great and I was able to help the team and project. At other times it was frustrating that what I thought was an important point was shrugged off or argued against. Almost every time this happened, I had to hold it in and refrain from the "I told you so" later down the road when it finally started to make sense what I was trying (and failing) to convey.

So here we are, its the end of another year and we are yet again in a similar place as we were going into the beginning of the year. I am once again working on transition documentation and planning talks to hand off this project I've been working for the last year to a new team. The good news is, I am much less attached to anything this time around due to the nature of not being on this project nearly as long.

So now we get to the whole point of this blog post. We just went over all the good and bad of the last year. Lets take a moment with that all in context to see what 2024 might have in store.

Well first of all, I have a blog now! How great is that? If you are enjoying what you are reading send it to a friend, share it on Xitter or the facebooks and help me get out there. If you haven't already checked out my other posts give that button at the top of the page a click and see if anything else catches your eye or at least check out my introduction post.

So as I look past my current project, I can think and hope for what the remainder of the year has for me.

Some of the things I am aiming for:

- A new project where I can pick back up as a team lead with a tech stack I am passionate about
- Continue to write blog posts with at least one every month with higher quality than this one (sorry not sorry)
- Explore something extremely new like game programming with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" className="text-blue-500">Godot</a>

Thanks again! And I hope you have an amazing 2024.
