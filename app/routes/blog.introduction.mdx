Welcome! My name is Corwin Marsh, I am a software engineer from the Greater Seattle Area. As I am approaching 10 years of working professionally in software, I decided I wanted a place where I could do some reflection and share some of the things I have learned. I really hope it turns out that there is something to share given the amount of time I've been doing this stuff.

When I am working with other developers, I often will say something and want to provide a link for further reading if they want a place to start to dig deeper. Without a blog of my own, that means I am relying on others to write up the details of a topic to back up and further explain an opinion or experience I have.

Thankfully for topics such as testing or react query I can find a relevant post from [Kent C. Dodd's](https://kentcdodds.com/blog) or [TkDodo's](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/) blogs to share. However, I often find that I need to write up a more detailed description of a topic or opinion I have. Each time this happens, I have a missed opportunity to write up a blog post. With this post I would be able to share with more people and be able to quickly provide a link with a more well thought out explanation instead of whatever I can come up with in the moment.

Going forward, I will take note of these topics and add them to the list of blog posts I should write.

This is going to be primarily a technical blog focused on my opinions and experience over the last ten years working primarily on full stack web and mobile projects. I hope you find it useful! I don't plan to have any form of comments built into the site so find me on twitter or github if you have any questions!

Sorry in advance for the sarcasm, I can't help it.
